# World Space Tracked VR on iPhone - _uForis_
---
*Tech: ARKit, Google VR, Swift, Objective-C, C++, Nimble*

Prototype project which allowed a user to be inside out tracked in VR on a mobile device
Built by leveraging the positional tracking of ARKit, the rotational tracking from Google VR and lens distortion correction from Google VR to create a Google Cardboard level version of an inside out tracked headset (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift)

Using the rotational tracking and distortion from Google VR allows us to take advantage of its shorter latency and time warp like approximation to produce a better VR experience while maintaining positional tracking from ARKit.
