*Tech: ARKit, Metal, Swift, Objective-C, C++, Nimble*

Prototype project built to showcase multiple scales in ARKit. This allows a user to anchor a model of a housing unit in space or on a plane detected by ARKit. It allows the user to scale the model to any size they choose or to enter "Tour" mode where the location becomes full scale (and has a nice background out the windows) so that the user can get a 1:1 feeling of the space.

3d scene rendered by the Nimble engine by uForis VR, a fast, lightweight engine designed for excellent mobile performance

Source code for this project is currently unavailable as the Nimble engine is currently closed source
